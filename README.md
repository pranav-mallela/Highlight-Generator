# A Small Video-Language Model for Sparse Action Spotting

* Sparse action spotting methods in sports have traditionally been CNN or feature-extractor based

* We introduce a purely token-based pipeline that, when given a video of a sports game, can extract desirable highlights.

* A user should be able to query our system: “Give me all the highlights of free-kicks.”, and receive a response: “A free-kick occurs at (36:09, 36:24)”.
